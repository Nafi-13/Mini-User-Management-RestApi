# Mini-User-Management-RestApi

Project Description: SpringBoot REST API for User and Department Management

The SpringBoot REST API for User and Department Management is a mini backend project designed to facilitate the creation, 
retrieval, updating, and deletion of users and departments. This API utilizes the SpringBoot framework and integrates with a MySQL database 
through Hibernate, enabling efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.

Steps to run :
1. Download the full folder
2. Open it in your preferred IDE. I used Intellij.
3. Run it as Spring Application.
4. I used MySQL as database. You will need to have MySql installed.
5. The local port of MySql was 3306 in my case. if needed, change it in the application.properties.
6. Use Postman to play with the apis.
